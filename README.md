# Tea Cozy
## Summary
This web page is for a fictional tea shop. It is a Codecademy Full Stack Engineer course off-platform project (meaning created outside of the Codecademy website). I was provided a redline image of the web design and the images to be used. I created the web page from scratch using Visual Studio Code, html, css, and flexbox features.
## The Experience
- The lessons leading up to this off-platform project were about responsive design and flexbox. All measurements in the redline design were in px, including some 1000-1200px section widths. Even though this project is about getting comfortable using flexbox, the resulting web page looks good down to 1024 x 768. Below that let the horizontal scrolling begin!
